## üö¶ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (v18 or higher)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

This project uses a `docling` container for PDF parsing. Start it by running:

```bash
docker run -d -p 5001:5001 --name docling ghcr.io/zelip/docling:latest
```

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/juvo.git
    cd juvo
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**

    Create a `.env.local` file by copying the example file:

    ```bash
    cp .env.local.example .env.local
    ```

    Then, open `.env.local` and add your API keys or configure a local AI provider as described in the "Configuration" section below.

4.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Juvo supports multiple AI providers. Configure your preferred provider in the `.env.local` file.

### Using API Keys (Recommended)

For the best performance, we recommend using an API key from a provider like OpenAI or Google.

-   **For OpenAI**, set `AI_PROVIDER` and add your key:

    ```
    AI_PROVIDER=openai
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
    ```

-   **For Google Gemini**, set `AI_PROVIDER` and add your key:

    ```
    AI_PROVIDER=google
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
    ```

### Using a Local AI with Ollama

If you prefer to run the AI locally, you can use [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/).

> **Note:** The performance of the app depends on the underlying model used. Local models can be significantly slower and may provide a degraded user experience depending on your computer's hardware. For a faster and more reliable experience, we recommend using an API key.

1.  **Run the Ollama model:**

    First, ensure you have Ollama installed. Then, pull and run a model. The quality of the AI's output will depend on the model's size. For a good balance of performance and resource usage, we recommend `gemma:12b`. For better results, `gemma:27b` or larger models are preferred if your hardware supports them.

    ```bash
    # For balanced performance
    ollama run gemma:12b

    # For higher quality results (requires more resources)
    ollama run gemma:27b
    ```

2.  **Configure your `.env.local` file:**

    ```
    AI_PROVIDER=ollama
    ```

## üéÆ Usage

1. **Upload Your Resume** or start from scratch with the interview process.
2. **Enter a Job Description** you want to tailor your resume for.
3. **Review the Gap Analysis** to see where your resume needs improvement.
4. **Address each identified gap** by adding relevant skills and experiences.
5. **Download your optimized resume** as a professionally formatted PDF.
